NAF MC MURDO--(May 14)-- A blizzard struck this base today, with 28 hours of 38-knot winds or above. The highest average hourly velocity was 50 knots, and peak gusts reached 82.5 knots.

Hardest hit were wires and antennas, but a minimum of building damage was sustained. A rundown of damage is as follows:

Seventy-five foot pole down in feed-in end of Balboa Rhombic; Balboa Rhobic wire down; New Zealand Rhombic wire down; Palmer Peninsula doublet loosened and split in middle; north-south and east-west doublets loosened; all Rhombic poles have aminimum <!--TYPO--> of two guys each detached, and some poles are held up by one guy only; approximately 1,000 feet of all transmission lines down with standoff insulators snapped and remaining transmission lines loosened considerably; tarpaulin on false roof of transmitter building partly blown off; snow entered transmitter building and found way into some transmitters, but equipment was off at time; one power line pole down; approximately 800 feet of power line down; nine stations on the power amplifier system inoperative; various guy wire failures and resulting 75-foot pole collapse due to turnbuckle loosening and finally paring as a result of vibration in guy wires by high winds.

Estimated completion date for damage repair is June 7, depending upon the weather.

SOUTH POLE STATION--(May 11)-- According to data and records available at this station, a new world's low temperature record was established at the South Pole today. At 2:30p.m. (Greenwich, England, time; 9:30 a.m. EST) the official temperature registered 100&#176; below zero Fahrenheit, marking the low point of two days of steadily falling temperature.

The previous record low was recorded in the northern Siberian village of Verkoyansk in February, 1892, when the thermometer there descended to 90 degrees below zero.

The temperature inside the tunnels surrounding and interconnecting the buildings lags behind the temperature outside, but it was already close in -72&#176;. Moist air from the buildings causes dense fog in the tunnels, reducing visibility to a matter of yards.

Outside the air was perfectly clear as the moon slowly rose above the horizon to cast the only natural light (other than starlight and the Aurora Australis) that will be seen here until the return of the sun on Sept. 23.

The normal routine of the 18 men manning the South Pole continued despite difficulties imposed by the decreasing temperature, and knowing that the thermometer will probably drop another 20 degrees.

By the calendar, winter does not officially begin until June 21, but the frost is already on the "punkins."

LITTLE AMERICA--(May 12)-- Simultaneous with the establishment of the world's lowest official temperature record of -100&#176; Fahrenheit at the South Pole Station, Little America experienced a record-breaking "heat wave."

On May 11 the thermometer at Little America registered plus 30&#176;F., a difference of 130 degrees within a distance of approimately 700 nautical miles.
