            <ab>LITTLE AMERICA -- Little America's "ice dentists" are at work again filling a cavity
               in a crevasse.</ab>
            <lb/>
            <p>One mile from camp on the road to the barrier it is necessary to cross a mysterious
               creeping crevasse. This is the <choice>
                  <sic>eight</sic>
                  <corr>eighth</corr>
               </choice> time the crevasse has been filled since January. It keeps opening and no
               one knows what happens to the hundreds of tons of snow which are used to fill it each
               time.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>The crevasse is like a jagged gorge approximately 50 feet deep, crossing the road at
               a 90&#176; angle. By descending on a rope ladder to the bottom of the crevasse, a man
               can walk one quarter mile in either direction from the road, hemmed in by the
               towering cliffs of glistening blue granite-like ice, varying from 10 to 20 feet
               apart.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>A man's first trip into such a crevasse is fascinating but terrifying. The ghostly
               silence is overwhelming and unnerving. But the silence is not prolonged, for
               intermittently one will hear a deep rumble, muffled booming, rasping groan or sharp,
               cracking, splintering sounds. It is the imperceptible movement of the ice, as if it
               were wincing in excruciating pain under the relentless pressure of its own weight,
               aggravated by the perpetually undulating sea beneath. This, combined with a feeling
               of utter impotence should the walls of ice give away (which the eerie sounds seem to
               suggest) will reduce all but the bravest souls to flight.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>On April 28 the oceanographic study group reported a crack 18 inches wide across the
               road upon their return from the barrier. This was a tipoff of an open crevasse
               beneath, transforming the road into a booby trap.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>The next day, in minus 54&#176; weather whipped by a 15-knot wind, a repair team
               composed of LCDR Howard J. Orndorff, Officer in Charge of Little America, of
               Nutterfort, W. Va.; LTJG Robert K. White of Glen Falls, N.Y.; Julian P. Gudmunson,
               Chief <choice>

               </choice> , of St. Paul, Minn.; Charles M. Darter, Chief Construction Driver, of
               Austin, Texas; Robert W. Anderson, Electronics Technician 3/c, of White City, Kan.;
               and Alvin L. Miller, Construction Driver 2/c, of Milton, Fla.; tackled the job armed
               with dynamite and a D-8 tractor.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Anderson is a veteran of conquering crevasses, having explored approximately 100 of
               them last November when blazing the 647 mile trail to Byrd Station. He sometimes
               swung at the end of a 50-foot rope like a pendulum, planting blasting charges at the
               most vulnerable spot deep in the jaws of a crevasse.</p>
            <lb/>
            <ab>Gudmunson is a seasoned expert in ice blasting, having worked as right hand man to
               Arctic Specialist MAJ Merle R. Dawson, USAR, last January when they changed the face
               of the barrier by carving a berth for cargo ships, and in the process creating what
               might have been the first man-made Antarctic icebergs.</ab>
            <lb/>
            <p>Miller is a versatile, <choice>
                  <sic>indefatigible</sic>
                  <corr>indefatigable</corr>
               </choice> worker and hardened to intense cold by daily exposure. He drove a D-8
               tractor on a 1300 mile record round-trip to Byrd Station.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Like capable dentists the repair team proceeded to clean the cavity carefully before
               filling. Eight blasts later all were aghast at the yawning chasm before them which a
               short time earlier had been the road. In the dim light of the sunless Antarctic
               winter dusk, Darter mounted his roaring iron monster, clicked on the floodlights and
               began pushing mountainous heaps of snow into the crevasse. With the touch of a genius
               he handled the gargantuan tractor as if it were a toy, advancing to the lip of the
               crevasse, then watching the snow cascade like a tumbling white waterfall into the
               abyss below.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Final phase of the operation was to pack the snowfill solid by running the 38-ton
               tractor over it numerous times. Now the road is as good as new. Once again the
               spectacular has been the routine in the Antarctic.</p>

            <p>WILKES STATION -- (April 29) -- Through his glasses Norwegian Glaciologist Olav Loken
               had been studying a seal lying on an ice floe in nearby Frogman Cove. He decided
               definitely it was a rare Ross Seal.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Leaving his vantage point on the overhanging rocks he hurried to make known his
               discovery to the other men at the station. At about 2 p.m. Station Scientific Leader
               Carl R. Eklund of Atlanta, Ga., came on the intercom system and announced the
               discovery to everyone, stating that an attempt would be made to collect the creature
               for the National Museum.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>From a hill which separates the station from the cove, the men watched Rudolf A.
               Honkala, Meteorologist, of Salisbury, N.H., and LTJG Donald R. Burnett of Mount
               Clemens, Mich., raise their rifles and take careful aim at the seal which was lying
               on an ice floe about 30 yards out in the cove.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Reminding them to be careful not to hit the seal's skull, Eklund gave them the signal
               to fire. The animal was an easy target and died quickly.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Now they were sure the seal itself would not escape, but it began to look like the
               outgoing tide might float the floe out to sea. They had to get a line on the dead
               seal quickly. Honkala and Garth H. Stonehocker, Ionospheric Physicist, of Portsmouth,
               Va., dragged a 20-foot ladder down to the ice edge, followed by Duane J. Wonsey,
               Construction Mechanic Constructionman,, of Elm Hall, Mich., and David Daniel,
               Commissaryman 3/c, of Fairfield, Texas, carrying coils of line.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Tying the line about him and laying the ladder across the dangerously thin ice,
               Honkala inched his way toward the floe where the dead seal lay. When he reached the
               floe he cut a hole in the seal's jaw and tied the line through it. While he was <choice>

                  <corr>doing</corr>
               </choice> this Wonsey had gone to get a "weasel" which would be used to tow the huge
               carcass to shore.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>When the treaded vehicle was in position, Daniel, who had been tending the line to
               Honkala, secured the line to the rear of the weasel. With a wave from Honkala, Wonsey
               was given the go-ahead. With a large splash the rare mammal was hauled from the floe,
               through the thin ice to shore.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>On measuring the seal it was found to be 102 inches long from the tip of his tail to
               his nose. The estimated weight was between 700 and 800 pounds. This was a great day
               for Wilkes Station as there have been few Ross Seals ever collected.</p>

               </choice> TRANSMISSION TO ANTARCTICA -- The first successful transmission of sports
               pictures and Sunday comics to the Antarctic was made on Sunday, May 5, via radio
               facsimile. The transmission was accomplished by radio amateurs in the United States,
               more than 8,000 miles from the point of reception.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>The pictures were transmitted to the Antarctic by W2KCR at North Syracuse, N.Y., and
               the Operation Deep Freeze Committee of the Radio Amateurs of Greater Syracuse as a
               function of the American Red Cross Amateur Radio Morale Message Service. The new
               radio picture transmissions are a forecast of similar and more personal transmissions
               in the future.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Transmission from North Syracuse began near midnight Saturday and continued until 6
               a.m. that morning. During that time several pictures were sent, each requiring an
               average of 40 minutes for direct transmission to Little America. Transmissions
               included a picture of the recent knockout of middleweight champion Gene Fullmer by
               Sugar Ray Robinson, a Dick Tracy Sunday comic strip and news. Printer's type 1/32 of
               an inch was sent legibly.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>The transmission distance was 8,437 miles. Permission was granted to the amateur
               radio Committee by the Federal Communications Commission to send facsimile on teh 20
               meter band between 14300 and 14350 kilocycles. Atmospheric conditions were reported
