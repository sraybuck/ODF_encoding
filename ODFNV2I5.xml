               filling a cavity in a crevasse.</ab>
            <lb/>
            <p>One mile from camp on the road to the barrier it is necessary to cross a mysterious
               creeping crevasse. This is the <choice>
                  <sic>eight</sic>
                  <corr>eighth</corr>
               </choice> time the crevasse has been filled since January. It keeps opening and no
               one knows what happens to the hundreds of tons of snow which are used to fill it each
               time.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>The crevasse is like a jagged gorge approximately 50 feet deep, crossing the road at
               a 90&#176; angle. By descending on a rope ladder to the bottom of the crevasse, a man
               can walk one quarter mile in either direction from the road, hemmed in by the
               towering cliffs of glistening blue granite-like ice, varying from 10 to 20 feet
               apart.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>A man's first trip into such a crevasse is fascinating but terrifying. The ghostly
               silence is overwhelming and unnerving. But the silence is not prolonged, for
               intermittently one will hear a deep rumble, muffled booming, rasping groan or sharp,
               cracking, splintering sounds. It is the imperceptible movement of the ice, as if it
               were wincing in excruciating pain under the relentless pressure of its own weight,
               aggravated by the perpetually undulating sea beneath. This, combined with a feeling
               of utter impotence should the walls of ice give away (which the eerie sounds seem to
               suggest) will reduce all but the bravest souls to flight.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>On <date when="1957-04-28">April 28</date> the oceanographic study group reported a
               crack 18 inches wide across the road upon their return from the barrier. This was a
               tipoff of an open crevasse beneath, transforming the road into a booby trap.</p>

               sometimes swung at the end of a 50-foot rope like a pendulum, planting blasting

            <lb/>
            <p>Like capable dentists the repair team proceeded to clean the cavity carefully before
               filling. Eight blasts later all were aghast at the yawning chasm before them which a
               short time earlier had been the road. In the dim light of the sunless Antarctic
               winter dusk, Darter mounted his roaring iron monster, clicked on the floodlights and
               began pushing mountainous heaps of snow into the crevasse. With the touch of a genius
               he handled the gargantuan tractor as if it were a toy, advancing to the lip of the
               crevasse, then watching the snow cascade like a tumbling white waterfall into the
               abyss below.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Final phase of the operation was to pack the snowfill solid by running the 38-ton
               tractor over it numerous times. Now the road is as good as new. Once again the
               spectacular has been the routine in the Antarctic.</p>

               seal lying on an ice floe in nearby Frogman Cove. He decided definitely it was a rare

            <lb/>
            <p>Leaving his vantage point on the overhanging rocks he hurried to make known his

               collect the creature for the National Museum.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>From a hill which separates the station from the cove, the men watched <persName

                  ref="#SalisburyNH">Salisbury, N.H.</placeName>, and <persName
                  ref="#DonaldRBurnett">LTJG Donald R. Burnett</persName> of Mount Clemens, Mich.,
               raise their rifles and take careful aim at the seal which was lying on an ice floe
               about 30 yards out in the cove.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Reminding them to be careful not to hit the seal's skull, Eklund gave them the signal
               to fire. The animal was an easy target and died quickly.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Now they were sure the seal itself would not escape, but it began to look like the
               outgoing tide might float the floe out to sea. They had to get a line on the dead
               seal quickly. Honkala and Garth H. Stonehocker, Ionospheric Physicist, of Portsmouth,
               Va., dragged a 20-foot ladder down to the ice edge, followed by Duane J. Wonsey,
               Construction Mechanic Constructionman,, of Elm Hall, Mich., and David Daniel,
               Commissaryman 3/c, of Fairfield, Texas, carrying coils of line.</p>

            <p>Tying the line about him and laying the ladder across the dangerously thin ice,
               Honkala inched his way toward the floe where the dead seal lay. When he reached the
               floe he cut a hole in the seal's jaw and tied the line through it. While he was <choice>

            <lb/>
            <p>When the treaded vehicle was in position, Daniel, who had been tending the line to
               Honkala, secured the line to the rear of the weasel. With a wave from Honkala, Wonsey
               was given the go-ahead. With a large splash the rare mammal was hauled from the floe,
               through the thin ice to shore.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>On measuring the seal it was found to be 102 inches long from the tip of his tail to
               his nose. The estimated weight was between 700 and 800 pounds. This was a great day
               for Wilkes Station as there have been few Ross Seals ever collected.</p>

            <p>The pictures were transmitted to the Antarctic by W2KCR at North Syracuse, N.Y., and

               future transmissions are planned for the duration of the International Geophysical
               Year. The Navy itself has transmitted radio facsimile to the Antarctic for many
               months. The radio amateurs, however, stress the sending of information that is
               personal, nonofficial, and of a morale nature.</p>
