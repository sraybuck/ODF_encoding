LITTLE AMERICA -- The major portion of the non-sectarian Easter sunrise service at Little America was dedication of the New Richard E. Byrd chapel.

Services were conducted, commencing at the time the sun rose, at approximately 10 a.m. However, the service was unique in that the sun set at about the same time the service was concluded. Two days after Easter marked the last sunrise until next August.

The new chapel is by far the most beautiful building at Little America. All have followed its construction with interest. From the laying of its foundations to finishing its pews, every task has been done conscientiously, even reverently. Volunteers carved the foundation from hard-packed snow on a crisp, clear day when the temperature hovered in the minus fifties. Quickly the framework of the 16 by 40 foot Jamesway building went up, and was them trimly covered with snug spun-glass insulated blanket sections.

The chancel section of the chapel is raised six inches above the nave and separated by a communion rail exquisitely hand finished. The chancel contains stalls for a small choir on the left side, an elevated mahogany altar in the center, the pulpit and electronic piano on the right. American and Christian flags flank the altar. The altar is dressed with a maroon velour cover bearing the words "Holy Holy Holy" in gold across the front piece edged with gold fringe, reversible cross-crucifix, matched vases and candlesticks, two seven-branch candelabra, and a missal stand. A dossal hanging behind the altar is of heavy blue velour extending from the arching ceiling to the deck. Flanking the dossal are white woolen panels reaching to the curving walls. The deck is soft green polished tile. The entire chancel area is illuminated by concealed overhead floodlights.

The nave is fitted with hand-hewn pews containing built-in kneelers and screens in front of the first pew on each side. All woodwork is stained mahogany. The center aisle and the area between the pew screens and chancel is green vinyl tile with an inlaid cross of white tile centered in the aisle. Remainder of the deck is battleship green linoleum. Interior walls are light green with dark olive green framework. The chapel will seat approximately 40.

Skilled cabinet maker John E. Reilly, builder 1/c, of New Orleans, assisted by Jack C. Rees, construction driver 2/c of West Warwick, R. I., designed and built the chancel communion rail, and pews, and did most of the interior finishing. Supervising construction of the building were Lt. (jg) Robert K. White of Glens Falls, N. Y., and Julian P Gudmunson, chief builder, of St. Paul, Minn. Many other volunteers participated in the construction. All at Little America believe Admiral Byrd would be pleased and proud to know that this chapel bears his name.
