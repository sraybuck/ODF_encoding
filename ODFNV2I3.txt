LITTLE AMERICA -- The major portion of the non-sectarian Easter sunrise service at Little America was dedication of the New Richard E. Byrd chapel.

Services were conducted, commencing at the time the sun rose, at approximately 10 a.m. However, the service was unique in that the sun set at about the same time the service was concluded. Two days after Easter marked the last sunrise until next August.

The new chapel is by far the most beautiful building at Little America. All have followed its construction with interest. From the laying of its foundations to finishing its pews, every task has been done conscientiously, even reverently. Volunteers carved the foundation from hard-packed snow on a crisp, clear day when the temperature hovered in the minus fifties. Quickly the framework of the 16 by 40 foot Jamesway building went up, and was them trimly covered with snug spun-glass insulated blanket sections.

The chancel section of the chapel is raised six inches above the nave and separated by a communion rail exquisitely hand finished. The chancel contains stalls for a small choir on the left side, an elevated mahogany altar in the center, the pulpit and electronic piano on the right. American and Christian flags flank the altar. The altar is dressed with a maroon velour cover bearing the words "Holy Holy Holy" in gold across the front piece edged with gold fringe, reversible cross-crucifix, matched vases and candlesticks, two seven-branch candelabra, and a missal stand. A dossal hanging behind the altar is of heavy blue velour extending from the arching ceiling to the deck. Flanking the dossal are white woolen panels reaching to the curving walls. The deck is soft green polished tile. The entire chancel area is illuminated by concealed overhead floodlights.

The nave is fitted with hand-hewn pews containing built-in kneelers and screens in front of the first pew on each side. All woodwork is stained mahogany. The center aisle and the area between the pew screens and chancel is green vinyl tile with an inlaid cross of white tile centered in the aisle. Remainder of the deck is battleship green linoleum. Interior walls are light green with dark olive green framework. The chapel will seat approximately 40.

Skilled cabinet maker John E. Reilly, builder 1/c, of New Orleans, assisted by Jack C. Rees, construction driver 2/c of West Warwick, R. I., designed and built the chancel communion rail, and pews, and did most of the interior finishing. Supervising construction of the building were Lt. (jg) Robert K. White of Glens Falls, N. Y., and Julian P Gudmunson, chief builder, of St. Paul, Minn. Many other volunteers participated in the construction. All at Little America believe Admiral Byrd would be pleased and proud to know that this chapel bears his name.

NAF MCMURDO -- This station played host to New Zealanders on Easter Sunday. Eighteen men from the New Zealand Scott base, with their leader Sit Edmund Hillary of Mt. Everest fame, accepted an invitation to Easter dinner and joined U.S. personnel at divine services.

The chapel, "Our Lady of the Snows," was appropriately decorated with artificial Easter lilies. Catholic mass and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament was offered by Father Leon S. Darkowski of Pittsburgh, Pa. Protestant services were held by lay leader Robert H. Wakeman, radioman 2/c. of Walton, N. Y., with Lt. Donald C. Hauck, DC, of Kandiyott, Minn., at the organ.

Other activities included attendance at movies, a hi-fi concert featuring Handel's "Messiah," and competitive games in the recreation hall. The guests expressed appreciation for the hospitality and invited McMurdo personnel to visit Scott Base. The U.S. and New Zealand bases are two miles apart. Much good will has been promoted through this exchange of social courtesies.

AROUND THE BASES -- NAF MCMURDO: Ground Control Approach (flight radar) equipment has been disassembled for maintenance. Ice runway in good condition. . . . . . SOUTH POLE: Eight by twelve foot shell for glaciology laboratory has been completed. Two Rawinsonde observations (radar tracking of weather balloons) have been made daily since April 15 . . . . . BYRD STATION: Tunnel was partially collapsed due to the weight of a snow drift . . . . . WILKES STATION: Highly successful voice radio contact has been made with Little America.

WILKES STATION -- (April 22) -- Easy access to the icecap and good surface for 50 miles inland indicate ideal conditions for extensive traverse from this station. The traverse as projected would provide geophysical and geographical studies over one of the greatest unexplored regions of Antarctica.

The proposed trail is from Wilkes along the 110th East Meridian. The primary advantage of this route is the presence of fixed stations at the ends and middle of the trail to provide control for scientific observations.

It is proposed the trail operations will begin in late November, using a D-4 Caterpillar tractor and "weasels," with a second D-4 for partial support. The D-4 proved effective here pulling 20 tons to the satellite station in land at 4,000 foot elevation.

Seismic shots, magnetic observations, and glaciological studies are contemplated at intervals of 50 to 75 miles, with gravity and surface meteorological observations at 10-mil intervals.

LITTLE AMERICA -- Champion "pole sitter" at Little America is John Kieffer, electronics technical 3/c, of Napa, Calif. A volunteer to climb antenna poles to install insulators and wire, Kieffer's conquest of nearly fifty poles makes him undisputed champ.

Perched atop a pole in minutes fifty degrees weather, buffeted by bitter winds, and clumsy in heavy Antarctic clothing, the job is no picnic. Every possible safety precaution including spurs, safety belt and boatswain's chair is used.

Kieffer is an old hand at climbing. Before enlisting he had his own set of spurs and cleared fire breaks in the forest of his family's property.

Assisting in the operation is Thomas E. Gehringer, construction electrician 3/c, of Allentown, PA., a veteran lineman. When stationed on Guam, prior to volunteering for Deep Freeze, he maintained 150 antenna poles ranging 90 to 110 feet high at the Naval Communications Station there.

Gehringer says, "Clinging to the top of a pole in blazing 90-degree sun is quite a contrast to doing it at 50 below."

LITTLE AMERICA -- Intense cold plays strange tricks on outdoor workers. Dropping into the minus fifties, the chill factor is vastly increased by sharp winds. Richard Hills, photographer 2/c, of Fayette, Ala., after taking pictures atop a fuel tank, jumped off only to discover he couldn't bend his knees. His cold weather trousers had frozen stiff.
