BYRD STATION -- At this Antarctic station IGY scientists were astonished to find ice in the area reaching a depth of 7,800 to 9,750 feet. The scientists believe all this ice rests on land but it is not an established fact as yet.

NAF MCMURDO -- During one of many reconnaissance flights in the vicinity of this airbase, Major S. A. Antos USMC of Buffalo, N.Y., discovered what may be an Antarctic phenomenon. Situated near Marble Point and the Wilson-Piedmont Glacier, he saw a huge ice tunnel more than a mile long. He described it as, "A huge ice tube that looked as if a draw were frozen over the top of a cavernous hollow formed by melted glacier ice."

SOUTH POLE -- The lowest temperature observed thus far at the South Pole is 89 degrees below zero, recorded on April 2. This temperature exceeded the lowest ever recorded in North America -81 degrees observed at Snag, Yukon Territory, Canada, in Feb, 1947. It is one degree above the all-time world's record of 90 degrees below zero set in northeastern Siberia in Feb. 1933. As late March and early April roughly corresponds to September in the Northern Hemisphere, temperatures are expected to drop to 120 degrees below zero as mid-winter approaches.

WILKES STATION -- The flash of an arm, the roar of a cannon, and 1,800 square feet of net took flight in quest of the skua gull, a bird of Antarctica. this was immediately followed by the rapid crunching sound of men running over hard crusted snow. Such was the scene recently witnessed at this station in Vincennes Bay. Perhaps all but one of the persons who witnessed this spectacle had never seen anything just like it before. The man whose flashing arm gave the signal to fire the salvo was Carl Eklund, scientific leader at this base.

The spectators and participants in this operation saw fire and smoke bellow from three cannon muzzles. The muzzles were protruding about 12 inches out of the snow and aimed at 20 degrees elevation. But the thing that really amazed the onlookers was the sight of the flying net, for through the smoke of the blast the net could be seen being carried by the projectiles. In a low arching flight the net carried up and over and landed enveloping the gluttonous skuas feating <!--this was misspelled in the text--> on the remains of dead seals.

The setting off of the net resulted in a spontaneous rush of viewers to the scene of capture. First to reach teh area was Rudolf A. Honkala. Rudy is a U. S. Weather Bureau meteorologist stationed here as an assistant to Mr. Eklund. Right on his heels was Lt. Sheldon W. Grinnell, MC, USNR, of Carbondale, III. With a great deal of zeal, Honkala piled onto the net and attempted to grasp one of the trapped birds. His face soon had a look of perplexity and he began to wonder if this flurry of wings and claws was going to evade his grasp. By then he knew that this was no homing pigeon he was dealing with. But the same type of determination that brought him from his home in Salsibury, N. H., to the Antarctic, he managed to capture the bird.
