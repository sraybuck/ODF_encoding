BYRD STATION -- At this Antarctic station IGY scientists were astonished to find ice in the area reaching a depth of 7,800 to 9,750 feet. The scientists believe all this ice rests on land but it is not an established fact as yet.

NAF MCMURDO -- During one of many reconnaissance flights in the vicinity of this airbase, Major S. A. Antos USMC of Buffalo, N.Y., discovered what may be an Antarctic phenomenon. Situated near Marble Point and the Wilson-Piedmont Glacier, he saw a huge ice tunnel more than a mile long. He described it as, "A huge ice tube that looked as if a draw were frozen over the top of a cavernous hollow formed by melted glacier ice."

SOUTH POLE -- The lowest temperature observed thus far at the South Pole is 89 degrees below zero, recorded on April 2. This temperature exceeded the lowest ever recorded in North America -81 degrees observed at Snag, Yukon Territory, Canada, in Feb, 1947. It is one degree above the all-time world's record of 90 degrees below zero set in northeastern Siberia in Feb. 1933. As late March and early April roughly corresponds to September in the Northern Hemisphere, temperatures are expected to drop to 120 degrees below zero as mid-winter approaches.

WILKES STATION -- The flash of an arm, the roar of a cannon, and 1,800 square feet of net took flight in quest of the skua gull, a bird of Antarctica. this was immediately followed by the rapid crunching sound of men running over hard crusted snow. Such was the scene recently witnessed at this station in Vincennes Bay. Perhaps all but one of the persons who witnessed this spectacle had never seen anything just like it before. The man whose flashing arm gave the signal to fire the salvo was Carl Eklund, scientific leader at this base.

The spectators and participants in this operation saw fire and smoke bellow from three cannon muzzles. The muzzles were protruding about 12 inches out of the snow and aimed at 20 degrees elevation. But the thing that really amazed the onlookers was the sight of the flying net, for through the smoke of the blast the net could be seen being carried by the projectiles. In a low arching flight the net carried up and over and landed enveloping the gluttonous skuas feating <!--this was misspelled in the text--> on the remains of dead seals.

The setting off of the net resulted in a spontaneous rush of viewers to the scene of capture. First to reach teh area was Rudolf A. Honkala. Rudy is a U. S. Weather Bureau meteorologist stationed here as an assistant to Mr. Eklund. Right on his heels was Lt. Sheldon W. Grinnell, MC, USNR, of Carbondale, Ill. With a great deal of zeal, Honkala piled onto the net and attempted to grasp one of the trapped birds. His face soon had a look of perplexity and he began to wonder if this flurry of wings and claws was going to evade his grasp. By then he knew that this was no homing pigeon he was dealing with. But the same type of determination that brought him from his home in Salsibury, N. H., to the Antarctic, he managed to capture the bird.

The photographer on the job was Paul F. Noonan, photographer first class, of Boston, Mass. With one continuous movement, Noonan planted his camera tripod and shot a scene of Sydney E. Green, construction driver 3/c, of Rt.1, Colbert, Wash., brining a captured skua gull to Mr. Eklund so the bird could be banded. Mr. Eklund, who lives in Atlanta, Ga., is carrying on this operation in conjunction with his biological research in the Antarctic.

The creatures of this land, like the land itself, are quite mysterious to the outside world. To study them and their habitat is part of the IGY program here. Lt. Grinnell, assisted by Garth H. Stonehocker, chief ionospheric physicist at this station, put the birds in a cardboard carton so that they could be weighted. The gloves and heavy clothing worn by the men serve a twofold purpose. They not only protect them from the cold but also from the flashing claws and beaks of the birds.

One of the last persons to reach the capture area was Richard Berkley of Winter Park, Fla. Berkley, a geomagnetism specialist, manned the detonator which fired the salvo. After all the birds were weighted and banded, Ekund released the birds. The bringing of the cannons and net from the U.S. had proven its merit. This shot, the first of its kind ever made in Antarctica, had netted 13 birds. With the knowledge gained from this capture there will be more abundant catches in the future.

ELLESWORTH STATION -- A member of this station's wintering-over party says Navy cook Edward H. Davis of Clinton, Iowa, does more for morale than all the other base personnel put together. Davis rises at 4 a.m. to prepare early breakfast and his work isn't completed until 7:30 p.m., after the evening meal. He performs his work six days a week with a half day off on Sundays. Due to the heavy work load, vigorous atmosphere and tasty cooking Davis turns out, large amounts of food are being consumed at Ellsworth and the men are continually gaining weight.

Atles F. Lewis, aviation metalsmith 1/c, of Troy, N.C., has gained 25 pounds in five weeks. David estimates the men are eating one and a half times their normal amount of food. They are eating mostly proteins of which there consumption is twice that of a Stateside naval base for the same number of personnel. In the way of meats, Davis is serving mostly veal and pork now because it loses its flavor fastest. He is saving beef for last. There is enough veal, pork, chicken and liver for two more months. Then the fresh meat rations will be supplemented with canned foods. Carbohydrates are being consumed one and a half times above normal.

Due to the bitter cold there are lots of coffee breaks and coffee consumption has climbed to four times normal. Davis believes that with the comfartable <!--misspelled--> prefabricated buildings, recreation hall and nightly movies, this is a soft life compared with previous Antarctic expeditions. But he maintains he would never winter over again and in his own words, "Nothing will look better to me than home."
