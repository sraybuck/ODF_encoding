               IGY scientists were astonished to find ice in the area reaching a depth of 7,800 to
               9,750 feet. The scientists believe all this ice rests on land but it is not an
               established fact as yet.</p>

            <p>NAF MCMURDO -- During one of many reconnaissance flights in the vicinity of this
               airbase, Major S. A. Antos USMC of Buffalo, N.Y., discovered what may be an Antarctic
               phenomenon. Situated near Marble Point and the Wilson-Piedmont Glacier, he saw a huge
               ice tunnel more than a mile long. He described it as, "A huge ice tube that looked as
               if a draw were frozen over the top of a cavernous hollow formed by melted glacier
               ice."</p>

            <p>SOUTH POLE -- The lowest temperature observed thus far at the South Pole is 89
               degrees below zero, recorded on April 2. This temperature exceeded the lowest ever
               recorded in North America -81 degrees observed at Snag, Yukon Territory, Canada, in
               Feb, 1947. It is one degree above the all-time world's record of 90 degrees below
               zero set in northeastern Siberia in Feb. 1933. As late March and early April roughly
               corresponds to September in the Northern Hemisphere, temperatures are expected to
               drop to 120 degrees below zero as mid-winter approaches.</p>

               roar of a cannon, and 1,800 square feet of net took flight in quest of the skua gull,
               a bird of Antarctica. this was immediately followed by the rapid crunching sound of
               men running over hard crusted snow. Such was the scene recently witnessed at this
               station in Vincennes Bay. Perhaps all but one of the persons who witnessed this
               spectacle had never seen anything just like it before. The man whose flashing arm
               gave the signal to fire the salvo was <persName ref="#CarlEklund">Carl
                  Eklund</persName>, scientific leader at this base.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>The spectators and participants in this operation saw fire and smoke bellow from
               three cannon muzzles. The muzzles were protruding about 12 inches out of the snow and
               aimed at 20 degrees elevation. But the thing that really amazed the onlookers was the
               sight of the flying net, for through the smoke of the blast the net could be seen
               being carried by the projectiles. In a low arching flight the net carried up and over
               and landed enveloping the gluttonous skuas feating
               <!--this was misspelled in the text--> on the remains of dead seals.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>The setting off of the net resulted in a spontaneous rush of viewers to the scene of
               capture. First to reach teh area was <persName ref="#RudolfAHonkala">Rudolf A.

               zeal, <persName ref="#RudolfAHonkala">Honkala</persName> piled onto the net and
               attempted to grasp one of the trapped birds. His face soon had a look of perplexity
               and he began to wonder if this flurry of wings and claws was going to evade his
               grasp. By then he knew that this was no homing pigeon he was dealing with. But the
               same type of determination that brought him from his home in <placeName
                  ref="#SalisburyNH">Salsibury, N. H.</placeName>, to the Antarctic, he managed to
               capture the bird.</p>

               physicist at this station, put the birds in a cardboard carton so that they could be
               weighted. The gloves and heavy clothing worn by the men serve a twofold purpose. They
               not only protect them from the cold but also from the flashing claws and beaks of the
               birds.</p>

               birds were weighted and banded, <persName ref="#CarlEkund">Ekund</persName> released
               the birds. The bringing of the cannons and net from the U.S. had proven its merit.
               This shot, the first of its kind ever made in Antarctica, had netted 13 birds. With
               the knowledge gained from this capture there will be more abundant catches in the
               future.</p>

               He performs his work six days a week with a half day off on Sundays. Due to the heavy
               work load, vigorous atmosphere and tasty cooking Davis turns out, large amounts of
               food are being consumed at <placeName ref="#EllesworthStation">Ellsworth</placeName>

               weeks. <persName ref="#EdwardHDavis">Davis</persName> estimates the men are eating
               one and a half times their normal amount of food. They are eating mostly proteins of
               which there consumption is twice that of a Stateside naval base for the same number
               of personnel. In the way of meats, <persName ref="#EdwardHDavis">Davis</persName> is
               serving mostly veal and pork now because it loses its flavor fastest. He is saving
               beef for last. There is enough veal, pork, chicken and liver for two more months.
               Then the fresh meat rations will be supplemented with canned foods. Carbohydrates are
               being consumed one and a half times above normal.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Due to the bitter cold there are lots of coffee breaks and coffee consumption has
               climbed to four times normal. <persName ref="#EdwardHDavis">Davis</persName> believes
               that with the comfartable <!--misspelled--> prefabricated buildings, recreation hall
               and nightly movies, this is a soft life compared with previous Antarctic expeditions.
               But he maintains he would never winter over again and in his own words, "Nothing will
               look better to me than home."</p>
