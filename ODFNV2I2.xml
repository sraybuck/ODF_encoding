               IGY scientists were astonished to find ice in the area reaching a depth of 7,800 to

            <p>NAF MCMURDO -- During one of many reconnaissance flights in the vicinity of this
               airbase, Major S. A. Antos USMC of Buffalo, N.Y., discovered what may be an Antarctic
               phenomenon. Situated near Marble Point and the Wilson-Piedmont Glacier, he saw a huge
               ice tunnel more than a mile long. He described it as, "A huge ice tube that looked as
               if a draw were frozen over the top of a cavernous hollow formed by melted glacier

               recorded in North America -81 degrees observed at Snag, Yukon Territory, Canada, in
               Feb, 1947. It is one degree above the all-time world's record of 90 degrees below
               zero set in northeastern Siberia in Feb. 1933. As late March and early April roughly

               roar of a cannon, and 1,800 square feet of net took flight in quest of the skua gull,
               a bird of Antarctica. this was immediately followed by the rapid crunching sound of
               men running over hard crusted snow. Such was the scene recently witnessed at this
               station in Vincennes Bay. Perhaps all but one of the persons who witnessed this
               spectacle had never seen anything just like it before. The man whose flashing arm
               gave the signal to fire the salvo was <persName ref="#CarlEklund">Carl

            <lb/>
            <p>The spectators and participants in this operation saw fire and smoke bellow from
               three cannon muzzles. The muzzles were protruding about 12 inches out of the snow and
               aimed at 20 degrees elevation. But the thing that really amazed the onlookers was the
               sight of the flying net, for through the smoke of the blast the net could be seen
               being carried by the projectiles. In a low arching flight the net carried up and over
               and landed enveloping the gluttonous skuas feating
               <!--this was misspelled in the text--> on the remains of dead seals.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>The setting off of the net resulted in a spontaneous rush of viewers to the scene of

               grasp. By then he knew that this was no homing pigeon he was dealing with. But the

            <p>The 12 year veteran of Okinawa, Europe and Africa has served as a heavy equipment
               mechanic and is especially suited for the vigorous Antarctic extremes, having served
               in Greenland. A typical day for <persName ref="#WalterLDavis">Davis</persName>
               consists of supplying three buildings with snow which is melted into water. He
               accomplishes this by scooping up the snow with a D-3 tractor and dumping it on the
               roofs of the buildings. Then if the vehicle is in repair he tackles that. If not he
               continues on construction and maintenance of the base. He also maintains and repairs
               the diesel electric generators that supply the base with electricity. <persName

               Antarctic winter night and the return to the United States. He would like a tour of
               recruiting duty. In his own words, "one year down here is long enough."</p>

               this helps explain why husky Seabees, after doing a hard day's work, enjoyed trying

               shortened daylight have restricted outdoor work, and a recreation program is in
               effect for whatever leisure time is available.</ab>
            <lb/>
            <p>An enlisted recreation council was formed and includes Louis R. Maher, chief
               electronics technician, of Olathe, Kan.; Richard D. Harden, chief air controlman,
               Forth Worth, Tex.; Donald E. Blackenship, builder 1/c, Highland, Calif.; Marcus

            <p>The initiative of the council and the willingness of the men result in a well-rounded
               program. Off duty volunteers have converted a building into a recreation hall,

            <p>Other activities include movies, weekly bingo, and a one-hour Saturday evening
               social. Each week's program is supplied by the occupants of the respective huts. Last
               Saturday the officers performed courageously as the "Kool Kats" and presented a
