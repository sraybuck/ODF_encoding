               <p>LITTLE AMERICA (Delayed) -- (The following story was received from Little America
                  Station via radio messages from Lt. John E. Zoller, CHC, USN, of Bonita Springs,
                  Fla.) On Feb. 16, 1957, an air shipment of fresh eggs from New Zealand arrived at
                  Little America. While inspecting the eggs Dental Officer Lt. Robert J. Adams, DC,
                  USNR, of Memphis, Tenn., wondered if any of them were fertile. Assisted by William
                  R. Burns, RM3, USN, of Flint, Mich., and Boyd D. Russell, RM3, USN, of Waco,
                  Texas, they selected six for incubation. Even Richard H. Banasiak, CSI, USN, of
                  Ballston Lake, N. Y., the cook, approved, perhaps with hope for future fresh eggs
                  and poultry.</p>
               <lb/>
               <p>A Dental Incubator for scientific study of oral flora was utilized. Correct
                  temperature to hatch eggs was unknown. We consulted a research man for a culture
                  of a living virus within the egg. Yesterday, Dr. Adams handled the eggs. He was
                  elated at two positive embryos and two possible ones. The dental laboratory is now
                  the crossroads of the Little America Station. Everyone wants to see the eggs.
                  Strict visiting hours have been set up. Interest is tremendous and there is much
                  speculation as to sex, color, breed and birthdate of the unborn chick. All hands
                  are anticipating the day the chicken will hatch. Estimated time of arrival is
                  March 9th.</p>
               <lb/>
               <p>We believe this will be the first chicken ever hatched within the Antarctic
                  Circle. If the chick survives, Dr. Adams plans to bring the history-making bird
                  home. He says, "Considering the 3,000 mile flight from New Zealand, extended
                  exposure to cold and the age of the egg, this is a miracle". "We almost anticipate
                  the chicken will hatch with earmuffs and mukluks. I am beginning to know how an
                  expectant mother feels".</p>
               <lb/>
               <p>A name is needed for such a fabulous fowl. Friends in the United States are
                  invited to submit suggestions. A progress report will follow next week.</p>

               <p>Lt. Adams narrowly averted a chick catastrophe when the power failed for three
                  hours. Grasping an alcohol blowtorch, he rushed to the rescue and kept the
                  incubator at the proper temperature using candle light illumination. Dr. Adams is
                  becoming more like a mother hen every day. His face beams every time he handles
                  eggs or discusses the chick.</p>
               <lb/>
               <p>A carefully concocted feed mix includes oatmeal, wheat grain, cornmeal, powdered
                  eggs and milk. Expected chicks drinking water is spiked with terramycin and
                  multiple vitamin complex. A crushed china dish and egg shells will provide
                  roughage since no sand or gravel is available here.</p>
               <lb/>
               <p>The Little America Midwives Association is now an effective organ. They will
                  commence egg inspection every half hour on March 7th and continue until the
                  blessed event occurs. Dr. Adams has been designated the attending physician.
                  Midwives are William R. Burns, Thomas Gehringer, CE3, USN, of Allentown, Pa., and
                  Boyd D. Russell. The poor motherless chick will still need a name. Progress report
                  three will follow next week. </p>

                  bay that the baby chick was stillborn. Grief-stricken obstetrician Dr. Adams and
                  midwives Burns, Gehringer and Russell were nearly prostrate. Banasiak the cook
                  accepted the news stoically. "It was too much to hope for I guess, fresh eggs and

                  found an embryo of approximately ten days well formed". "Cause of death
                  undetermined, however, evidence of Big Eye, scourge of the Antarctic, was
                  present". Further investigation is pending.</p>

               <p>Hope still remains for several other eggs being carefully nurtured in the
                  incubator. Every conceivable precaution has been taken. We are trying to duplicate
                  exactly the care of a mother hen. Eggs are being turned daily. Midwives are
                  practicing how to cluck like a hen. We now have volunteers to massage the eggs
                  with bushy beards in lieu of a caress by a mother hen's feathers. Another progress

                  constructed from cotton fixed atop an old steam iron which provides thermostat
                  heat control and humidity. The thermostat failed recently and Butler became an
                  emergency human incubator, gently cradling the eggs under his arm. The thermostat
                  registers the exact correct temperature. Somewhat surprised, Butler asked, "What

                  guinea pig Butler attempted to duplicate the exact action of the hen. His comment
                  was, "It sure is different chewing raw oatmeal and tilting my head back to

               tournament. The tabular berg is brand new, having just broken off from the Ross ice
               barrier. It is approximately 25 miles long, 10 miles wide and stands about 100 feet
               above water. The iceberg contains an estimated 63 billion tons of ice. We regret that
