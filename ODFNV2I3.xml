               the non-sectarian Easter sunrise service at Little America was dedication of the New
               Richard E. Byrd chapel.</ab>
            <lb/>
            <p>Services were conducted, commencing at the time the sun rose, at approximately 10
               a.m. However, the service was unique in that the sun set at about the same time the
               service was concluded. Two days after Easter marked the last sunrise until next
               August.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>The new chapel is by far the most beautiful building at Little America. All have
               followed its construction with interest. From the laying of its foundations to
               finishing its pews, every task has been done conscientiously, even reverently.
               Volunteers carved the foundation from hard-packed snow on a crisp, clear day when the
               temperature hovered in the minus fifties. Quickly the framework of the 16 by 40 foot
               Jamesway building went up, and was them trimly covered with snug spun-glass insulated
               blanket sections.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p> The chancel section of the chapel is raised six inches above the nave and separated
               by a communion rail exquisitely hand finished. The chancel contains stalls for a
               small choir on the left side, an elevated mahogany altar in the center, the pulpit
               and electronic piano on the right. American and Christian flags flank the altar. The
               altar is dressed with a maroon velour cover bearing the words "Holy Holy Holy" in
               gold across the front piece edged with gold fringe, reversible cross-crucifix,
               matched vases and candlesticks, two seven-branch candelabra, and a missal stand. A
               dossal hanging behind the altar is of heavy blue velour extending from the arching
               ceiling to the deck. Flanking the dossal are white woolen panels reaching to the
               curving walls. The deck is soft green polished tile. The entire chancel area is
               illuminated by concealed overhead floodlights.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>The nave is fitted with hand-hewn pews containing built-in kneelers and screens in
               front of the first pew on each side. All woodwork is stained mahogany. The center
               aisle and the area between the pew screens and chancel is green vinyl tile with an
               inlaid cross of white tile centered in the aisle. Remainder of the deck is battleship
               green linoleum. Interior walls are light green with dark olive green framework. The
               chapel will seat approximately 40.</p>

               station. The traverse as projected would provide geophysical and geographical studies
               over one of the greatest unexplored regions of Antarctica.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>The proposed trail is from Wilkes along the 110th East Meridian. The primary
               advantage of this route is the presence of fixed stations at the ends and middle of
               the trail to provide control for scientific observations.</p>

            <p>It is proposed the trail operations will begin in late November, using a D-4
               Caterpillar tractor and "weasels," with a second D-4 for partial support. The D-4
               proved effective here pulling 20 tons to the satellite station in land at 4,000 foot

            <p>In the mess hall were what appeared to be half a dozen Indians. The striking feature

            <p>The tribal affiliation is unknown, but it's suspected that they may be the last of
               the Mohicans. Much good natured joking and critical observations were made about the
               shape of the heads, bumps, knots and skin texture. There was also some speculation as
               to whether the hair will return. The "Indians" unanimously hope it will.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>A few new phrases were added to the camp vocabulary, including, "ugh" and "how." It
               was suggested that the aurora-sky watch be alert for smoke signals on the horizon. </p>

            <p>A radiosonde balloon (for recording temperature, air pressure and humidity, plus wind
               direction and velocity) sent aloft at 10 minutes past noon remained airborne and was
               tracked until 4:11 p.m., when the signal faded due to battery failure.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>The balloon rose to a record 96,276 feet. Temperature at this altitude was minus 87.7
               degrees F. The balloon was 70 miles form the station.</p>
